# Tic Tac Toe Game
This is my implementation of the famous tic tac toe game for two players using Python. 
I have created two versions of the game, one for the command line interface, and the other with a graphical user interface using PyQt5.

### Running the game locally:
-  [Python3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher is required.
- Clone/download the repsitory and `cd` into it.
- Install external dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the CLI version: `python version1_CLI.py`
- Run the GUI version: `python version2_GUI.py`

Enjoy the game.
